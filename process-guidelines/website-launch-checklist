# Development Process Guideline: Launching a Website on WPEngine

## Pre-launch
- [ ] **Backup** (WPEngine vs Plugin)
- [ ] **Update WordPress core and plugins**
- [ ] **Ask WPEngine to disable xmlrp.php requests**
- [ ] **Redirection map/permalinks**
- [ ] **Migration (if necessary):** Search for anomalies, broken links ([Broken Link Checker](https://www.brokenlinkcheck.com/broken-links.php))
- [ ] **Set WPengine (or another receiving host) domain configuration**
- [ ] **Update domain’s DNS:** Set WPEngine DNS info
- [ ] **WPEngine Portal:** Add domain(s)
- [ ] **Google Analytics:** 
  - [ ] Add code to `functions.php`
  - [ ] If necessary, get access to the client's account as contributors ([Google Analytics Help](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1009702?hl=en))
- [ ] **Backup the site:** Use WPEngine backup system or manually download a copy of the wp-content folder & database
- [ ] **Discourage Search Engines:** Make sure "Discourage Search Engines" is checked until after launch

### SEO Tasks
- [ ] **Verify XML Sitemap**
- [ ] **Create Robots.txt via Yoast**
  - [ ] Ensure it contains all the XML sitemaps
- [ ] **Update `functions.php`:** Ensure `has_archive` and `publicly_queryable` are set to `false`
- [ ] **Tags:** Max 10
- [ ] **Non-Public Pages:** Ensure all non-public pages can't be accessed (CPT archives, parent pages, modals, flyouts)
- [ ] **Yoast SEO Settings:**
  - [ ] Title/Description/Image metadata
  - [ ] Post Types + Taxonomy descriptions (Search Appearance)
  - [ ] Disable undesired CPTs and Taxonomies for single and archives (Search Appearance)
- [ ] **Create Robots.txt** (Tools → must show up in the root folder)
- [ ] **Add sitemaps to robots.txt**

## Launch
- [ ] **Green light:** Obtain client’s confirmation to launch the site
- [ ] **Point the domain:** Update DNS from the client’s Domain/Hosting provider
- [ ] **Wait for propagation** ([Check DNS Propagation](https://www.whatsmydns.net/))
- [ ] **Update WP Admin:**
  - [ ] Change URL on General Settings (Site URL & Home URL)
  - [ ] Uncheck Settings → Reading → Discourage robots
- [ ] **Search and replace URLs:** Use Better Search & Replace
- [ ] **Update WPEngine Portal:**
  - [ ] Set the primary domain
  - [ ] Redirect www and .wpengine domains to the main domain
- [ ] **Enable SSL:** Once propagation is complete

## Post Launch
- [ ] **Licenses:** Reinstate if needed (WPML, ACF, etc.)
- [ ] **Redirects / Permalinks:** Test to ensure they are working correctly
- [ ] **Google Analytics:** Confirm it is working (if given access)
- [ ] **WPForms:** Check primary valid email address
- [ ] **Caches:** Clear all caches (WPEngine, Beaver Builder, etc.)
- [ ] **SSL:** Ensure all URLs are HTTPS
- [ ] **GTMetrix:** Run and save a performance report
- [ ] **W3 Validator:** Check for HTML validation issues
- [ ] **Check for broken links** ([Broken Link Checker](https://www.brokenlinkcheck.com/broken-links.php))
